Hi! I am a graduate of CentraleSup√©lec in Data Science. I currently work at Weborama on recommendation systems. I am interested in video generation systems, particularly their potential for understanding physics, as well as their controllability and efficiency. I am very excited about the potential of these models for narrative creation and simulation.

In my free time, I enjoy sports (especially badminton) and travelling.
