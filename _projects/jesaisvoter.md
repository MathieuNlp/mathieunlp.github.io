How can we analyse the french political parties and their program?
The french municipales are in march and the aim is to help distinguish which tasks a political party wants to tackle but also help citizen see the coherence between the programs vows and votes in the french national assembly.
The goal of this project would be to better understand the political parties and with a PDF of their program, create a quick and nice visualisation of their focus points. Also, it would sensibilize the citizen to have a better understanding of the potilical ecosystem and a clear view based on what they want to accomplish.
I try my best in this work to not add any biases via code or models. Also, this is a tool and not a means to know incite which political party is the best.
The tool would be used to collect information and futher polish the user's believe and rightful judgement of the potilical party and situation.
